# project3

Isabel Jaramillo

My strengths are in writing HTML and I feel like I have developed a more
organized strategy where I can write with neat HTML syntax. I'd like to say I'm 'okay' with
CSS but would like to brush up on my skills working on media queries and layouts.
Javascript is my greatest weakness right now - but I am excited to work with it and
hope to get as much as I can out of this given this last project!
