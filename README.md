I believe that my strengths are in CSS. I like to make sure that my CSS is organized and I like to add in media queries to clean up the page and make it more responsive.
My weakness is JavaScript, purely based off of the reason that I haven't practiced using it yet. I'm sure that after this project I will gain more experience.

My strengths lie in Javascript, Im able to pick up new topics fairly quickly and easily and I am able to implement them with much success. I would like to work on integrating API into a webpage through javascript. I have never done it before and this project will give me that challenge.
